These less confident, as I may have had typing errors etc. Not sure what I did wrong exactly.

Took much longer than expected. Most mistakes were small, but took lots of time to find a real answer.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I will have to review the information/lessons and try them out again.

 Currently having problem with saving to github for the challenges, it is not saving correctly
